## Issues

You can report any technical issues faced from Github issues. Click on New issue and select the type of issue accordingly. 
If it is a bug bug that is found on existing workflow of the project and block or create problem on existing workflow, You can select the bug report option. And fill up all necessary details like title of issue, steps to reproduce, expected behavior, screenshot, device details and additional informations related to the issue.

 If you want additional feature to be integrated on platform which will enhance the user experience and functionality, You can choose the feature request option and fill up necessary details. 

## Labels
After submitting the issues proper labelling of issue is important. 
Label issues where appropriate, for example as backend or frontend.

If the issue is blocking other work, add the blocker label.

Priorities can be assigned as 'Nice to', 'Should', or 'Must'.

Difficulty can possibly be estimated using 'Effort Required: 1' '2' '3' labels Equivalent to story points to estimate relative effort required for a dev.
## Assignment
Assign issues to the dev who will work on it.This assigning can be done by developer themselves or Project lead or manager. 

# PRs
## Drafts
Create a draft PR for works in progress.

Push as early as possible to draft, especially if there is a chance you may get sidetracked on other work (so another dev could feasibly pick up where you left off).
## Assignment
Assign yourself if you are working on the issue.

Assign another dev if you need to pass off the development to them.

The re-assigned dev can then assign the task back to the original dev for validation.
## Review
Any developer can review a PR, as long as at least one dev reviews prior to merge.

Assign devs for review - frontend can review backend and vice versa.

Once review is complete and the PR is out of draft state, then any dev can merge the PR.
## Milestones
Encapsulates a set of issues into a logical bigger task, with an assigned end date.

Discussed in team meetings and decided on via priorities.

Project owner decides on priorities, tech lead decides on which tasks are required to achieve that goal.
## Roadmap
Higher level roadmap based on milestones.

A couple of milestones should be added for each release.

We no longer use the task board on Github, but we do manage the roadmap there.

The roadmap should include:

Milestones spanning the work start and end date.

Releases labelled over the top, showing the anticipated next release date and how it relates to the milestones.
## Discussions
To discuss more general topics in the public, so that anyone can contribute.

Partly used to document the design decisions we have taken.

Tag people specially for input, as it makes them more likely to add ideas.

We can also use these for the staging server tests on each release cycle: Staging --> production test acceptance requirements #1335
## Release Notes
No technical details, move those to a dropdown in markdown.

Higher level info on bugs fixed, new features added, things improved.

Add screenshots throughout the release notes to make it understandable by general users.
